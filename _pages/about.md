[cite_start]I am a research-driven graduate student completing two Master’s degrees at the **University of Geneva**: one in **Interdisciplinary Neuroscience** and one in **Advanced Research in Psychology**[cite: 6, 27, 28].

My academic journey reflects a commitment to bridging the gap between cognitive psychology and neuroscience. I possess extensive training in:
* **Behavioral Science & Experimental Design**
* [cite_start]**Neuroimaging:** fMRI, EEG, and MEG [cite: 7, 15]
* [cite_start]**Data Analysis:** Proficiency in R and Python [cite: 7, 16]

[cite_start]Currently, I am working on understanding memory and navigation strategies [cite: 41, 47][cite_start], aiming to apply evidence-based tools to enhance cognitive development[cite: 12].

[cite_start]In addition to my research, I am deeply involved in the academic community, serving as President of the Student’s Association of Psychology (ADEPSY) and the Council of Associations (CAPSE)[cite: 95, 100].
